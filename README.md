# [Helpers](https://helpers.pericodes.com/) by [Pericodes](https://github.com/pericodes)

As a developer I often need small tools that I Google. Most of them have advertising, insert unnecessary cookies, are paid, or are not comfortable to use. 

That's why I decided to create my own tools, made by and for developers, 100% open source and under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), without unnecessary cookies, without advertising and thinking about making them as comfortable as possible for the developer. 

Below you can see all the tools I have created and their corresponding Github repository.

If you think any of them can be improved, send me a Poll Request and if they are useful consider supporting me on Patreon.
